# Rational-numbers
This project shows how to design the Rational class for representing and processing rational numbers

A rational number has a numerator and a denominator in the form a/b, where a is the numerator and b the denominator. To reduce a rational number to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute values of its numerator and denominator, then divide both the numerator and denominator by this value. The main method created two rational numbers, r1 and r2 and displays the results.
